The amiibo bin to hex dump website is located here: 
https://games.kel.mn/amiibo 

How to create an amiibo:
1. Connect the arduino to the mac and open the arduino software
2. Open the Dump Info sketch and upload it to the RFID writer.
  If it cannot connect to the RFID writer then under the toolbar on the top of the screen,
  select tools > port > /dev/cu.usbmodem14101 (Arduino Uno)
3. Under the toolbar select tools > serial monitor to see the output from the RFID scanner
4. This sketch should make it so you can just put your tag on the RFID reader to get the card Info
5. Download the amiibo bin that you want at my google drive (Shared with me > amiibo bins, or just search
amiibo on google drive and it should find it)
6. Next, go to the amiibo bin to hex dump website (https://games.kel.mn/amiibo) and paste in the UID you got from
the Dump Info sketch, the amiibo bin and the key file (located in this directory which should be projects/amiibo)
7. Copy the hex dump from the website and go to the Arduino Write amiibo sketch and paste it in the dataBlock[] array
8. Upload the Write amiibo sketch to the Arduino
9. Follow instructions in the serial window (should just tell you when to put the tag on then watch it go)
